# Analysis of the CICIDS 2017 Dataset for Intrusion Detection Research ( Group 15 ) 

This repository contains our data mining project analyzing the CICIDS 2017 dataset for intrusion detection research.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the CICIDS 2017 dataset for intrusion detection research using data mining techniques.

## Dataset Overview

The **CICIDS 2017** dataset was developed by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) at the University of New Brunswick. It was created to provide a modern benchmark for training and evaluating intrusion detection systems (IDS) using machine learning and anomaly detection methods.

### Key Features

- **Realistic traffic patterns**: Includes both benign user activity and malicious attacks
- **Comprehensive attack coverage**: Contains major categories of cyberattacks including:
  - Brute Force attacks (FTP, SSH)
  - DoS/DDoS attacks
  - Web Attacks (XSS, SQL Injection)
  - Botnet activity
  - Port scanning and infiltration
- **Research relevance**: Widely recognized as one of the most comprehensive IDS datasets for academic research and cybersecurity system development
